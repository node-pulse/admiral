# Archived Documentation

**Date Archived:** 2025-10-31

These files have been archived and consolidated into a single comprehensive document.

## Consolidated Document

**Location:** `../metrics-architecture.md`

This unified document contains all information from:
- `simplified-metrics-schema.md`
- `process-monitoring-implementation-plan.md`
- `process-monitoring-implementation-complete.md`
- `PROCESS_MONITORING_COMPLETE.md`

## Why Consolidated?

Multiple documents covering the same topic (simplified metrics + process monitoring) led to:
- Duplicate information
- Inconsistencies between docs
- Harder to maintain
- Confusing for new developers

The new unified document provides:
- Complete architecture overview
- All implementation details in one place
- Consistent formatting
- Easier to search and reference

## Archived Files

1. **simplified-metrics-schema.md** - Original metrics implementation doc
2. **process-monitoring-implementation-plan.md** - Implementation plan for process monitoring
3. **process-monitoring-implementation-complete.md** - Backend review and payload structure fixes
4. **PROCESS_MONITORING_COMPLETE.md** - Complete end-to-end documentation

## Migration Note

If you need to reference these old documents, they are preserved here for historical purposes. However, **always refer to `metrics-architecture.md` for current, accurate information.**
